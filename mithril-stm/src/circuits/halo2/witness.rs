//! Circuit witness and instance boundary types for the Halo2 STM circuit.
//!
//! This module defines the exact public/private shapes consumed by the relation, while
//! keeping them separate from lower-level circuit primitives in `types.rs`.
//! Integrators should treat these types as the circuit-facing contract.
