# CBOR Codec — Compatibility Rules

This document describes the versioned CBOR encoding used by `mithril-stm` for
`to_bytes` / `from_bytes` and the rules to follow when evolving serialized
structures.

## Wire format

Every CBOR-encoded value is prefixed with a **version byte**:

```text
[version_byte = 0x01][CBOR payload]
```

The `from_bytes` implementation inspects the first byte:

- `0x01` — decode the remaining bytes as CBOR.
- Anything else — fall back to the legacy big-endian byte-packed decoder.

## Disambiguating legacy data from CBOR

The version byte `0x01` must never collide with the first byte of legacy data.
This works because most types start their legacy encoding with a big-endian
`u64` counter or length, whose most significant byte is `0x00` for any
realistic value (values below `2^56`).

The following table lists every type's legacy first byte and why it is safe:

| Type                                       | Legacy first byte                                       | Why safe                                                        |

| **`MerkleTreeCommitment`**                 | **Raw hash digest → any byte**                          | **Ambiguous — uses try-CBOR-then-fallback**                     |

### Special case: `MerkleTreeCommitment`

`MerkleTreeCommitment` (gated behind `future_snark`) stores its legacy format
as the raw Merkle root hash with no length prefix. The first byte of a hash
digest is pseudo-random and can be `0x01` (~0.4% probability). To handle this
ambiguity, its `from_bytes` method tries CBOR decoding first and falls back to
the legacy decoder if CBOR fails:

```rust
if codec::is_cbor_v1(bytes) {
    codec::from_cbor_bytes(&bytes[1..])
        .or_else(|_| Self::from_bytes_legacy(bytes))
} else {
    Self::from_bytes_legacy(bytes)
}
```

### Special case: `AggregateSignature`

`AggregateSignature` uses a type-discriminator byte as its legacy first byte:
`0x00` for `Concatenation` and `0x01` for `Snark` (gated behind `future_snark`).
The `Snark` discriminator collides with the CBOR version byte `0x01`. To handle
this ambiguity, its `from_bytes` method uses the same try-CBOR-then-fallback
pattern as `MerkleTreeCommitment`.

### Adding a new type

When adding `to_bytes` / `from_bytes` to a new type, verify that the legacy
format's first byte **cannot** be `0x01`. If the legacy format starts with raw
cryptographic material (hashes, signatures, public keys), use the
try-CBOR-then-fallback pattern shown above instead of the simple version-byte
dispatch.

## Backward compatibility (new code reads old data)

Handled automatically by the dual-read dispatch:

```rust
if codec::is_cbor_v1(bytes) {
    // decode CBOR
} else {
    Self::from_bytes_legacy(bytes)
}
```

No action is required when adding fields — old data that predates CBOR will
continue to be decoded through the legacy path.

## Forward compatibility (old code reads new data)

ciborium deserializes CBOR maps and **silently ignores unknown keys**. This
means that data produced by a newer version of the code (with extra fields) can
still be read by an older version that does not know about those fields.

## Adding a new field

1. Add the field to the struct (or to the envelope struct for types that use
   one).
2. Annotate it with `#[serde(default)]` so that data written before the field
   existed can still be decoded — the field will receive its `Default` value.

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct Parameters {
    pub m: u64,
    pub k: u64,
    pub phi_f: f64,
    #[serde(default)] // missing key decodes as 0
    pub new_field: u64,
}
```

For optional features, prefer `Option<T>` which defaults to `None`:

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct Parameters {
    pub m: u64,
    pub k: u64,
    pub phi_f: f64,
    #[serde(default)] // missing key decodes as None
    pub optional_feature: Option<String>,
}
```

No version byte bump is needed.

## Removing or renaming a field

**Do not remove or rename fields.** These are breaking changes because:

- Removing a field means old data that contains it can no longer populate the
  struct (the value is silently dropped, which may cause semantic errors).
- Renaming a field is equivalent to removing the old name and adding a new one.

If a field is no longer needed, deprecate it and stop writing meaningful values
to it, but keep it in the struct definition so old data can still be decoded.

## Changing a field type

**Do not change the type of an existing field.** For example, changing `u64` to
`String` will cause a deserialization error when reading data written with the
old type.

If you need a different type, add a new field with the desired type and
deprecate the old one.

## Bumping the version byte

The version byte should only be changed for an intentionally **breaking** format
migration. If you bump to `0x02`, add a new decoder branch:

```rust
if bytes[0] == 0x02 {
    // decode v2 CBOR
} else if codec::is_cbor_v1(bytes) {
    // decode v1 CBOR
} else {
    Self::from_bytes_legacy(bytes)
}
```

Under normal evolution (adding fields), this is **not** necessary.

## Envelope structs

Some types use intermediate envelope structs for CBOR serialization because
their `Serialize` and `Deserialize` implementations are incompatible with
ciborium (for example, custom tuple serialization paired with derived map
deserialization, or `#[serde(untagged)]`).

The same compatibility rules apply to envelope structs: add new fields with
`#[serde(default)]`, do not remove or rename existing fields.

## Golden byte tests

Every migrated type has a hardcoded `GOLDEN_CBOR_BYTES` constant and two
assertions:

- **`cbor_golden_bytes_can_be_decoded`** — verifies that `from_bytes` can
  decode the golden constant and that re-encoding produces the same bytes.
- **`cbor_encoding_is_stable`** — verifies that encoding the deterministic
  golden value produces exactly the golden constant.

Types whose serialization differs depending on cargo features (e.g.
`SingleSignature`, `ClosedRegistrationEntry`, `SingleSignatureWithRegisteredParty`)
have two `GOLDEN_CBOR_BYTES` constants gated with `#[cfg(not(feature = "future_snark"))]`
and `#[cfg(feature = "future_snark")]`.

Types whose encoding is non-deterministic (e.g. `AggregateSignature::Snark`,
because the underlying SNARK proof is non-deterministic) replace the stability
test with a legacy-to-CBOR roundtrip test.

The following table lists every type with its golden byte size(s):

| Type                                 | Bytes      | Feature-gated       |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------- | ------------------- |
| `MerkleBatchPath`                    | 155        | No                  |
| `MerklePath`                         | 149        | `future_snark` only |
| `MerkleTree`                         | 485        | No                  |
| `SingleSignature`                    | 131 / 396  | Yes                 |
| `ClosedRegistrationEntry`            | 219 / 433  | Yes                 |
| `SingleSignatureWithRegisteredParty` | 730 / 1721 | Yes                 |
| `Initializer`                        | 490        | No                  |
| `ConcatenationProof`                 | 2974       | No                  |
| `AggregateVerificationKeyForSnark`   | 115        | `future_snark` only |
| `AggregateSignature` (Concatenation) | 5937       | No                  |
| `AggregateSignature` (Snark)         | 19234      | `future_snark` only |

When adding a field with `#[serde(default)]`, the existing golden bytes remain
valid (the new field is absent and defaults). However, the **encoding** of the
golden value will change if the golden value construction produces a non-default
value for the new field. In that case, update the `GOLDEN_CBOR_BYTES` constant
accordingly.
