## Mithril Distribution [2517.0] - 2025-05-05

- **BREAKING** changes in Mithril client CLI and library:
  - To fast bootstrap a Cardano node, the new `--include-ancillary` option has been added to the _Cardano node database_ command in the Mithril client CLI.
  - Without this option, only final immutable files are downloaded, and the ledger state must be computed from the genesis block when the Cardano node starts.
  - The `--include-ancillary` option requires the usage of an **ancillary verification key** (`--ancillary-verification-key` or `ANCILLARY_VERIFICATION_KEY`) which is specified in the [Networks configuration](https://mithril.network/doc/manual/getting-started/network-configurations) page.
  - Clients from distribution [`2513`](#mithril-distribution-25130---2025-03-28) and earlier are **not compatible** with this change and **must be updated**.

- Support for `Cardano node` `10.3.1` in the signer and the aggregator.

- Support for ancillary files signature for _Cardano node database_ and _Cardano node database v2_ certification with IOG key.

- Support for origin tags in Mithril client library, CLI and WASM to record the origin of client requests.

- **UNSTABLE** implement support for leader/follower registration in the infrastructure.
