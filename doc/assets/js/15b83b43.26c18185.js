This internal store mechanism used to be a bunch of JSON files saved in a given directory. Even though this does the job it still presents flaws: data are hard to query when debugging especially when crossing data (which signers have participated in this multi-signature?). Also, data are stored in different places which can be a problem when moving these files from one place to another.
