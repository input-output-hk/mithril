# Mithril client library example: Snapshot

## Description

This example shows how to implement a Mithril client and use its features related to the `Snapshot` type.

In this example, the client interacts by default with a real aggregator on the network `testing-preview` to:

- list the available snapshots
- get a single snapshot
- download and unpack a snapshot archive
- verify a certificate chain
- compute a message for a Snapshot
- verify that the certificate signs the computed message
- increments snapshot download statistics

The crate [indicatif](https://docs.rs/indicatif/latest/indicatif/) is used to nicely report the progress to the console.

## Build and run the example

```bash
# Build from the crate directory
cargo build

# Run from the crate directory
cargo run

# Run with your custom network configuration
AGGREGATOR_ENDPOINT=YOUR_AGGREGATOR_ENDPOINT GENESIS_VERIFICATION_KEY=YOUR_GENESIS_VERIFICATION_KEY cargo run

# Example with 'pre-release-preview' network
AGGREGATOR_ENDPOINT=https://aggregator.pre-release-preview.api.mithril.network/aggregator GENESIS_VERIFICATION_KEY=$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/input-output-hk/mithril/main/mithril-infra/configuration/pre-release-preview/genesis.vkey) cargo run
```
