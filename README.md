## :sunny: Introduction

**Mithril** is a research project the goal of which is to provide [stake-based threshold multi-signatures](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/mithril-stake-based-threshold-multisignatures/)(STM) on top of the **Cardano network**.

In a nutshell, **Mithril** can be summarized as:

> A protocol that enables stakeholders in a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain network to individually sign messages, which are then aggregated into a multi-signature, guaranteeing that they represent a minimum share of the total stake.

In other words, an adversarial participant with less than this share of the total stake will be unable to produce valid multi-signatures. :closed_lock_with_key:.

The goal of the first implementation of the Mithril network protocol is to provide a way to fast bootstrap a fully operating Cardano node in less than two hours, compared to the days it used to take before.

To unleash the power of Mithril and leverage new use cases, we have also implemented a framework in the Mithril network that allows the certification of multiple types of data, provided they can be computed deterministically.

## :shield: Mainnet availability

**Mithril** is currently a work in progress, and is available in its [**beta**](https://mithril.network/doc/dev-blog/2023/07/21/mainnet-beta-launch) version on mainnet.

:heavy_check_mark: It is ready to be safely deployed in the SPO production infrastructure for **Cardano** mainnet.

:warning: It is **NOT** yet completely ready for production usage of the artifacts produced before a minimum level of participation in the network (which depends on the artifact type).

### Disclaimer

By using Mithril protocol, you understand the protocol is in development and that use of the `mithril-signer`, `mithril-aggregator` and `mithril-client` on mainnet is entirely at your own risk.

You also acknowledge and agree to have an adequate understanding of the risks associated with use of the Mithril network and that all information and materials published, distributed or otherwise made available on mithril.network and Mithril Github Repository is available on an ‚ÄòAS IS‚Äô and ‚ÄòAS AVAILABLE‚Äô basis, without any representations or warranties of any kind.

## :rocket: Getting started with Mithril

If you are a **Cardano SPO**, a good entry point is the [SPO onboarding guide](https://mithril.network/doc/manual/getting-started/SPO-on-boarding-guide).
Additionally, you can find detailed instructions for running a **signer node** in [this guide](https://mithril.network/doc/manual/getting-started/run-signer-node).

If you are interested in **fast bootstrapping** of a Cardano node, please refer to [this guide](https://mithril.network/doc/manual/getting-started/bootstrap-cardano-node).

Get access to tutorials, user manual, guides and plenty of documentation on our [website](https://mithril.network/doc)!

## :satellite: Structure of the repository

This repository consists of the following parts:

- [**Mithril aggregator**](./mithril-aggregator): the node of the **Mithril network** responsible for collecting individual signatures from the **Mithril signers** and aggregating them into a multi-signature. The **Mithril aggregator** uses this ability to provide certified snapshots of the **Cardano** blockchain.

- [**Mithril client**](./mithril-client): this is the **client** library that can be used by developers to interact with Mithril certified data in their applications.

- [**Mithril client CLI**](./mithril-client-cli): the CLI used for retrieving the certified artifacts produced by the **Mithril network**, eg the **Cardano** chain certified snapshots used to securely restore a **Cardano node**.

- [**Mithril client WASM**](./mithril-client-wasm): the WASM compatible library used for retrieving the certified artifacts produced by the **Mithril network**.

- [**Mithril common**](./mithril-common): this is the **common** library that is used by the **Mithril network** nodes.

- [**Mithril STM**](./mithril-stm): the **core** library that implements **Mithril** protocol cryptographic engine.

- [**Mithril explorer**](./mithril-explorer): the **explorer** website that connects to a **Mithril aggregator** and displays its **Certificate chain** and artifacts.

- [**Mithril infrastructure**](./mithril-infra): the infrastructure used to power a **Mithril network** in the cloud.

- [**Mithril signer**](./mithril-signer): the node of the **Mithril network** responsible for producing individual signatures that are collected and aggregated by the **Mithril aggregator**.

- [**Internal**](./internal): the shared tools and API used by **Mithril** crates.

  - [**Mithril build script**](./internal/mithril-build-script): a toolbox for Mithril crates using a build scripts phase.

  - [**Mithril doc**](./internal/mithril-doc): an API that generates markdown documentation for a crate command lines arguments.

  - [**Mithril doc derive**](./internal/mithril-doc-derive): a macro implementation used by **Mithril doc**.

  - [**Mithril persistence**](./internal/mithril-persistence): the **persistence** library that is used by the **Mithril network** nodes.

- [**Mithril test lab**](./mithril-test-lab): the suite of tools that allow us to test and stress the **Mithril** protocol implementations.

  - [**Mithril devnet**](./mithril-test-lab/mithril-devnet): the private **Mithril/Cardano network** used to scaffold a **Mithril network** on top of a **Cardano network**.

  - [**Mithril end to end**](./mithril-test-lab/mithril-end-to-end): the tool used to run tests scenarios against a **Mithril devnet**.

- [**Protocol demonstration**](./demo/protocol-demo): a simple CLI that helps understand how the **Mithril** protocol works and the role of its **protocol parameters**.

- [**Examples**](./examples): out of the box working examples to get familiar with **Mithril**.
