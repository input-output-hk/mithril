# Mithril

Mithril is an research project to provide [Stake-based Threshold Multisignatures](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/mithrilstake-based-threshold-multisignatures/) on top of Cardano network. It's essentially a protocol that allows _stakeholders_ in a Proof-of-Stake blockchain network to individually _sign messages_ and aggregate those signatures in a _certificate_ or _proof_ in such a way that it guarantees stakeholders represent a "random" fraction (the threshold) of total stake. In other words, a malicious participant with less than this fraction won't be able to tamper with the produced certificate.

This repository aims at hosting the various artefacts produced as part of the _prototyping phase_: Documentation, PoCs and prototype code...
