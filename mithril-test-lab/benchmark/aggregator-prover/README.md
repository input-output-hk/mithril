# Benchmark aggregator prover route

This tool will run a set of benchmarks (based on [Apache Benchmark](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html)) on the aggregator route of an aggregator given a list of transactions. It will produce a CSV file with results of the benchmarks.

First set enviroment variables:

```bash
# Aggregator endpoint
export AGGREGATOR_ENDPOINT=https://aggregator.testing-mainnet.api.mithril.network/aggregator

# Transactions file to prove
export TRANSACTIONS_FILE=transactions-mainnet.txt

# Transactions proved per request range definition
export TRANSACTIONS_PER_REQUEST_MIN=1
export TRANSACTIONS_PER_REQUEST_MAX=3
export TRANSACTIONS_PER_REQUEST_STEP=1

# Apache benchmark total request sent per benchmark
export AB_TOTAL_REQUESTS=1000

# Apache benchmark concurrency level range definition
export AB_CONCURRENCY_MIN=50
export AB_CONCURRENCY_MAX=100
export AB_CONCURRENCY_STEP=50
```

Then, run the benchmarks:

```bash
./benchmark-aggregator-prover.sh
```

Which will output these type of results:

```bash
