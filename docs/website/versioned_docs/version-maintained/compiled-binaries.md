Each Release / Pre-Release distribution comes with pre compiled binaries ready to use or wrapped in a debian package
for linux¹.

You can download them from the Release / Pre-Release distribution page that depends on the Mithril Network you
are targeting.

These links are available in the **Build From** column of the above **Mithril Networks** table.

¹ The Linux binaries target `glibc`, and have a minimum requirement of `glibc 2.31` (compatible with `Ubuntu 20.04`
or `Debian Bullseye`).
