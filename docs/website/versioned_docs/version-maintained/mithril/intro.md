# About Mithril

:::info

Explore the Mithril protocol through our [protocol simulation](./mithril-protocol/simulation.md). This interactive experience will provide you with insights into how participants collaborate to generate a **multi-signature**, and you'll also gain a clearer understanding of the protocol parameters.

## Mithril in a nutshell

Mithril is a research project whose goal is to provide [Stake-based Threshold Multisignatures](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/mithrilstake-based-threshold-multisignatures/) on top of the Cardano network.

In a nutshell, Mithril can be summarized as:

> A protocol that allows stakeholders in a proof-of-stake blockchain network to individually sign messages that are aggregated into a multi-signature, which guarantees that they represent a minimum share of the total stake.

In other words, an adversarial participant with less than this share of the total stake will not be able to produce valid multi-signatures :closed_lock_with_key:.
