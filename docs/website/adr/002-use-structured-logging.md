## Status

Superseded by [ADR 7](/adr/7)

## Context

- Logs are a critical tool for operating any software system, enabling [observability](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-measurement-monitoring-and-observability) of the system.
- Following [12 Factor Apps](https://12factor.net/logs) principles, providing the needed components and tools to be able to configure logging and monitoring should not be the responsibility of the software components

## Decision

_Therefore_

- Each component of the system use [Structured logging](https://www.sumologic.com/glossary/structured-logging/) using documented and standardised JSON format for its logs
- Logs are always emitted to `stdout` of the process the component is part of

## Consequences

- The schema of the logged items should be properly documented in a JSON schema
- It is the responsibility of the node operator to consume the logs and process them
- We use existing libraries to provide needed log infrastructure, like [slog](https://zsiciarz.github.io/24daysofrust/book/vol2/day4.html) for Rust
