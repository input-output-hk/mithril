### Mithril client npm is open to developers on npmjs.com

The Mithril team has published the first release (**v0.1.7)** of its [mithril-client-wasm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mithril-dev/mithril-client-wasm) npm package on npmjs.com.

The **Mithril client npm package** allows developers to use all the tooling necessary to manipulate Mithril certified types from a Mithril Aggregator directly in their (web) applications and to develop their own Mithril clients in any supported browser!

Here are some useful documentation that can be used by developers:

- **Example of implementations**: https://mithril.network/doc/manual/developer-docs/nodes/mithril-client-library-wasm
- **Mithril client npm package repository**: https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/tree/main/mithril-client-wasm
