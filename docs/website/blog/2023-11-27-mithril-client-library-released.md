### Mithril client library is open to developers on crates.io

The Mithril team has published the first release (**v0.5.7)** of its [mithril-client](https://crates.io/crates/mithril-client) library on crates.io.

The **Mithril client library** allows developers to use all the tooling necessary to manipulate Mithril certified types from a Mithril Aggregator directly in their (Rust) applications and to develop their own Mithril clients!

Here are some useful documentation that can be used by developers:
- **Developer documentation**: https://docs.rs/mithril-client/0.5.7/mithril_client/
- **Example of implementations**:https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/blob/main/mithril-client/examples/
- **Mithril client repository**: https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/tree/main/mithril-client
- **Crates.io**: https://crates.io/crates/mithril-client
