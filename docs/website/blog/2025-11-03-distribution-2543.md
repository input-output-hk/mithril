### Distribution `2543` is now available

The [`2543.0`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2543.0) distribution has been released, introducing the following changes:

- Added support for default incremental backend (v2) for Cardano database restoration in the client library, CLI and WASM
- Added support for enhanced verification of a Cardano database which provides a list of tampered and missing files in case of failure in the client library and CLI
- Added support for artifacts retrieval by epoch for the Cardano database and Cardano stake distribution in the client library, CLI and WASM
- Deprecated the `with_aggregator_client` and `new` functions in the `ClientBuilder` struct of the client library
- General bug fixes and performance improvements.

This new distribution has been deployed to the **Mithril aggregator** on the `release-mainnet` and `release-preprod` networks.

For those running a **Mithril signer**:

- **pre-release-preview** network: no action is required at this time
- **release-preprod** network: upgrade the signer node binary to version `0.2.273` – no configuration changes are required
- **release-mainnet** network: upgrade the signer node binary to version `0.2.273`– no configuration changes are required.

You can update the Mithril signer using the one-line command below. By default, it downloads to the current directory, but you can specify a custom folder with the -p option:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/input-output-hk/mithril/refs/heads/main/mithril-install.sh | sh -s -- -c mithril-signer -d 2543.0 -p $(pwd)
```
