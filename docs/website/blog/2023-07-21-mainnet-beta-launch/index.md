**Update 2023/07/30**: The first certificates and snapshots have been produced by the `release-mainnet` network!

**Update 2023/07/25**: The Genesis certificate of the `release-mainnet` network has been successfully created.

### Mithril Protocol’s Mainnet Beta is launched :rocket:

The Mithril team is thrilled to announce that the **Mithril Protocol’s Mainnet Beta** is launched :tada:

Here are the next steps that we will follow in order to get the `release-mainnet` network producing its first certificates:

1. [x] Open the first signers registrations on the `release-mainnet` network (1 epoch).
1. [x] Create the genesis certificate of the `release-mainnet` network (1 epoch).
1. [x] Wait for the first certificates to be produced by the `release-mainnet` network.

This is an expected timeline, in case of modification, we will amend this post with a new one.

Also, the documentation has been updated with the configuration of the `release-mainnet` network. It is available [here](https://mithril.network/doc/manual/developer-docs/references#mithril-networks).

:::danger

As a Cardano SPO, before being able to setup a Mithril signer on the `mainnet`, it is required to complete the **step 2** of the [SPO onboarding guide](https://mithril.network/doc/manual/getting-started/SPO-on-boarding-guide#step-2-get-mithril-ready-for-mainnet)
