### Distribution `2603` is now available

The [`2603.1`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2603.1) distribution has been released, introducing the following changes:

- **Breaking changes**: progress bars and spinners in the Mithril client CLI now output to `stderr` instead of `stdout` 
- **Deprecations**: deprecated `cardano_db` function in library/WASM; removed `snapshot` function from `Client` struct; deprecated `--backend v1` flag in the CLI (use `--backend v2` instead)
- **Decentralization support**: introduced a new `/protocol-configuration/{epoch}` route for fetching aggregator configuration; refactored signer and aggregator to read network configurations from `MithrilNetworkConfigurationProvider`; follower aggregators can now read configurations from the leader aggregator
- **Miscellaneous**: replaced CExplorer API with Blockfrost API for pool names/tickers discovery; introduced support for the new Lagrange Mithril era; applied bug fixes and performance improvements
- **Unstable**: added DMQ protocol support in signer, aggregator and relay; implemented aggregator discovery mechanism in client library and CLI
- General bug fixes and performance improvements.

This new distribution has been deployed to the **Mithril aggregator** on the `release-mainnet` and `release-preprod` networks.

For those running a **Mithril signer**:

- **pre-release-preview** network: no action is required at this time
- **release-preprod** network: upgrade the signer node binary to version `0.3.7` – no configuration changes are required
- **release-mainnet** network: upgrade the signer node binary to version `0.3.7` – no configuration changes are required.

You can update the Mithril signer using the one-line command below. By default, it downloads to the current directory, but you can specify a custom folder with the -p option:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/input-output-hk/mithril/refs/heads/main/mithril-install.sh | sh -s -- -c mithril-signer -d 2603.1 -p $(pwd)
```
