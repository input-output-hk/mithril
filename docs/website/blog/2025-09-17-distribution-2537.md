### Distribution `2537` is now available

The [`2537.0`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2537.0) distribution has been released, introducing the following changes:

- Support for `Cardano node` `10.5.1` in the signer and the aggregator
- Support for stable `cardano_database_v2` backend in the `mithril-client` library
- Support for stable `v2` backend of `cardano-db` command and decommission of `cardano-db-v2` command in client CLI
- Support for stable `verify` command to verify an existing Cardano database in the client CLI
- Support for stable UTxO-HD snapshot converter `tools utxo-hd snapshot-converter` command in client CLI
- Support for pre-built Linux ARM binaries for the signer, client CLI, and aggregator
- Support for the Rust `2024` edition (from `2021` edition)
- Bug fixes and performance improvements.

This new distribution has been deployed to the **Mithril aggregator** on the `release-mainnet` and `release-preprod` networks.

If running a **Mithril signer**:

- **pre-release-preview** network: no action required at this time
- **release-preprod** network: upgrade the signer node binary to version `0.2.268` – no configuration changes required
- **release-mainnet** network: upgrade the signer node binary to version `0.2.268`– no configuration changes required.

You can update the Mithril signer using the one-line command below. It downloads to the current directory by default, but you can specify a custom folder using the -p option:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/input-output-hk/mithril/refs/heads/main/mithril-install.sh | sh -s -- -c mithril-signer -d 2537.0 -p $(pwd)
```
