### Mithril signer `1.0.0` is production-ready

With the [`2617.0`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2617.0) distribution, the Mithril signer has reached its first stable version, `1.0.0`, and is now officially production-ready on the `release-mainnet` network.

#### What does this mean?

Since the [mainnet beta launch](https://mithril.network/doc/dev-blog/2023/07/21/mainnet-beta-launch) in July 2023, the Mithril signer has been continuously improved, hardened, and validated by the community of stake pool operators running it on the Cardano `release-mainnet` network. The `1.0.0` release marks the point at which the team considers the signer:

- Stable in terms of public API, configuration, and operational behavior
- Performant across supported platforms (Linux x86_64, Linux ARM64)
- Secure, following many iterations of review and hardening of the signing pipeline
- Reliable for long-running production deployments on `release-mainnet`.

From this release onwards, backward-incompatible changes to the Mithril signer will follow the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) convention and will be announced in dedicated dev blog posts.

#### Upgrade path

If you operate a Mithril signer on `release-mainnet` or `release-preprod`, upgrade to version `1.0.0` as part of the distribution [`2617.0`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2617.0) rollout (no configuration changes are required):

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/input-output-hk/mithril/refs/heads/main/mithril-install.sh | sh -s -- -c mithril-signer -d 2617.0 -p $(pwd)
```

Thank you to all the pioneer SPOs who have been running the Mithril signer and providing feedback since the earliest iterations. This stable release would not have been possible without your contributions.
