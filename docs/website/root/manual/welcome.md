# User manual

Welcome to the **Mithril** user manual!

Let's discover **Mithril in less than five minutes**.

## Introduction

A **Mithril network** consists of three main components:

- **Mithril aggregator**:

This node coordinates the production of the Cardano snapshot archives, working alongside Mithril signer and Cardano nodes to generate associated certificates using Mithril multi-signatures.

- **Mithril signer**:

This node is responsible for producing individual signatures, which are then combined into a multi-signature by the Mithril aggregator. It operates in conjunction with a Cardano node (run by a stake pool operator (SPO)) holding stake in the network.

- **Mithril client**:

This node verifies and restores a snapshot, facilitating lightning-fast bootstrapping of a Cardano full node. It plays a crucial role in ensuring the efficiency of the network.

## Get started

To get started with the setup, make sure you have the following components and tools:

- A Linux (preferred) or macOS computer

- A [correctly configured](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) Rust toolchain (latest stable version)

- A recent version of [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

- A recent version of [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

- A recent version of [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) (1.6+)

Having these requirements in place will enable you to proceed smoothly with the setup and configuration for your project.

## Read the user manual

In the [**Getting started**](/doc/category/getting-started) guide in the user manual, you will find tutorials for:

- [Bootstrapping a Cardano node](./getting-started/bootstrap-cardano-node.md) on `testnet`
