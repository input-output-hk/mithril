# Mithril network architecture

:::info

- The current Mithril network relies on a single aggregator. However, the team is working on a more decentralized version, where multiple aggregators will operate within the same Mithril network.

## Mithril nodes

The network is composed of the following nodes:

- [**Mithril aggregator**](./aggregator.md):

> The trustless node that orchestrates the work of the Mithril signer nodes, gathering their individual signatures to produce Mithril multi-signatures and their associated certificates. The aggregator is also in charge of creating and storing the ledger state snapshot archives.

- [**Mithril signer**](./signer.md):

> The node that works transparently on top of the stake pool operator's Cardano node and individually signs the Cardano chain state.

- [**Mithril client**](./client.md):

> The node used to restore artifacts produced by a Mithril aggregator. It then employs Mithril cryptographic primitives to verify their authenticity and validity.

- **Mithril relay**:

> A forward proxy that is used to secure communications between the Mithril signer and the Mithril aggregator. More information is available in the [Mithril signer deployment model](../../manual/getting-started/run-signer-node#mithril-signer-deployment-model) section.
