# Protocol Demo / Rust cli

**This is a work in progress** :hammer_and_wrench:

This cli implements a very simple version of the Mithril protocol for demonstration only

---

## Pre-requisites

**Install Rust**

- Install a [correctly configured](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) Rust toolchain (latest stable version).
- Install Build Tools `build-essential` and `m4`. For example, on Ubuntu/Debian/Mint, run `sudo apt install build-essential m4`.

## Download source code

```bash
# Download sources from github
git clone https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril

# Go to sources directory
cd demo/protocol-demo
```

## Development test and build

```bash
# Test
make test

# Help
make help

# Doc
make doc

# Run with default configuration
make run
```

## Release build and run binary

```bash
# Build
make build

# Help
./mithrildemo --help

# Run
./mithrildemo

# Run with custom configuration
./mithrildemo -k 5 -m 50 --phi-f 0.65 --nparties 5 --nmessages 2
```

## Example output

```
>> Launch Mithril protocol demonstrator with configuration:
Config {
    m: 100,
    k: 5,
    phi_f: 0.2,
    nparties: 5,
    nmessages: 1,
}

>> Protocol establish phase
